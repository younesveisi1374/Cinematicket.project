"""
This code defines a module that provides functionality related to UUID generation and user authentication. It imports the `getpass` module and then defines a class called `User`. 

The `User` class represents a user in the system and handles user-related operations such as counting users and storing usernames. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. The `class User` block is the definition of the `User` class.

2. Inside the `User` class, there are some class-level attributes: `_user_counter` and `_usernames`. `_user_counter` is used to keep track of the total number of users, while `_usernames` is a set used to store all the usernames.

3. The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `User` class. It takes in the `username`, `password`, and optionally the `number_phone`. Inside the constructor, it assigns the validated `username` to the `username` attribute of the object. It also assigns the validated `password` to the `_password` attribute (note the underscore indicating it is intended to be private). The provided `number_phone` parameter value is assigned to the `number_phone` attribute of the object. Finally, it generates a unique ID for the user by calling the `_generate_user_id()` method defined in the `User` class.

4. The `_generate_user_id(cls)` method is a class method that generates a unique ID as a number. It increments the `_user_counter` class attribute by 1 and returns the updated value as the generated user ID.

5. The `_validate_username(self, username)` method is an instance method that validates the username and checks for duplicates. It checks if the given username already exists in the set of usernames (`User._usernames`). If it does, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "Username is already taken". If the username is not taken, it adds the username to the set of usernames and returns the validated username.

6. The `_validate_password(self, password)` method is an instance method that validates the password and checks for the minimum length. It checks if the length of the password is less than 4 characters. If it is, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "Password must be at least 4 characters long". If the password is valid, it returns the validated password.

7. The `update_info(self, new_username=None, new_number_phone=None)` method allows the user to update their information with an optional new username and/or a new number phone. It takes in two parameters: `new_username` (a string) and `new_number_phone` (a string). If a new username is provided, it updates the `username` attribute with the new value. If a new number phone is provided, it updates the `number_phone` attribute with the new value.

8. The `change_password(self)` method prompts the user to enter their current password and then allows them to change their password. It uses the `getpass` module to securely prompt for passwords. First, it prompts the user to enter their current password. If the entered current password does not match the stored password (`self._password`), it prints an error message ("Error: Incorrect current password") and returns. If the entered current password matches the stored password, it prompts the user to enter a new password and confirms the new password. If the entered new passwords do not match, it prints an error message ("Error: New passwords do not match") and returns. If the entered new passwords match, it updates the stored password with the new password and prints a success message ("Password changed successfully").

The rest of the code is not included in the provided snippet, but you would continue adding your own code below the `class User` block.
